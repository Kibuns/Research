# Agile Research

## What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?
According to the Interaction Design Foundation agile development is
> an iterative software-development methodology which teams use in projects. Self-organized, cross-functional teams frequently analyze circumstances and user needs to adapt projects. Scrum teams constantly improve quality in sprints with short-term deliverables. They show Agile development in action.

According to the Agile Alliance agile development is 
> an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it.

The Agile Manifesto is a document that sets out the key values and principles behind the Agile philosophy
and serves to help development teams work more efficiently and sustainably.
In the Agile manifesto, there are 4 key values. These are:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile also has 12 base principles which are the following(according to the Agile Alliance):
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


## Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
There is no general consensus on which methods are the most popular, but by comparing multiple sources it seems that the following 3 are always near the top:
1. Scrum

One of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development methodology, which is depicted by various cycles of development. Similar to Kanban, Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called ‘sprints’. The development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, thereby managing only one sprint at a time.

2. KanBan

The word Kanban is of Japanese origin and its meaning is linked to a time concept, “just-in-time”. In practice, the Kanban method exists in a board or table (Kanban board), divided into columns, that shows every flow of the software production. As the development evolves, the information contained in the table changes, and when a new task comes into play, a new “card” is created.
The Kanban method requires communication and transparency so that the members of a team can know exactly at what stage the development is and can see the status of the project at any time. [source](https://www.xpand-it.com/blog/top-5-agile-methodologies/)

3. Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and feedback. It focuses on constant development and customer satisfaction. Similar to scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a team to create a productive and highly efficient environment.

## Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book? 
Scrum is an agile project management framework that focusses on teamwork where teams develop, deliver and sustain complex products. It got its name from rugby, because in this sport, teamwork is also very important. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experience (training), look at succes to see what went well, and look at failure to see what can be improved, just like a rugby team. To allow for this reflection, scrum teams are encouraged to develop iteratively. Planning, sprints, standups, and retrospectives to have a continuous overview of the project, and be able to continually improve.
Some people use Agile and Scrum interchangeably. But they are not the same.
Scrum is about continuously shipping value to customers. It's a framework for getting work done. While agile is a set of values and principles,
Scrum is used for people to work and start to think in an agile way. Scrum can be used in a lot of different work environments, but is the most popular with software developers and software engineers. It's the favourite framework for these people for a few reasons. First of, as you may know, software requirements, goals and situations keep changing throughout the projects lifespan. Scrum is really good in these kinds of projects because it embraces change. the short itterations in scrum development can also reduce risks and costs.


## Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum? 
1. Kanban
With Kanban, teams focus about visualizing their work and limiting the work in progress. They try to maximize efficiency (or flow). They do this to reduce the time a project takes from start to finish. The kanban board is used to continuously improve their workflow. 

2. Scrum
With Scrum, teams focus on shipping working software, often through set intervals called sprints. They try to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams will plan meetings, standups and retrospectives to keep an overview of the project and see where they can improve and what they can keep doing. 


The difference between Kanban and Scrum are that Kanban teams focus on refining and visualizing their workflow while have a continuous workflow, while scrum teams focus on iteratively shipping working software to the customer in the form of sprints. They create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback, while Kanban teams mainly focus on maximizing efficiency. Scrum teams release their working products often at the end of each sprint, while Kanban teams deliver Continuously. Kanban team also often don't have roles, while Scrum teams have product owners, scrum master, dev team, etc. 

These focus points aren't exclusive to any one of these methods. It's just that one methods mainly focuses on one thing, and the other mainly focusses on other things. While the practices differ, the principles pretty much the same. Both frameworks will help you build better products and services easier.

## Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods?
(expert interview)

## Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?   
For my individual project I used Trello, which is a simple Kanban board made by Atlassian. I used this because I had a pretty clear goal in mind, and I just wanted to focus on limiting the amount of work in progess and reduce the time the project took from start to finish. In the beginning of the semester I still wanted to find a new workflow, and the Trello Kanban board was a great way to keep improving that.

With our group project, our team decided to use JIRA. Which is a agile management tool that uses Scrum boards. We chose this tool because the team wanted to learn something new, and we saw the potential in it. Up until now it has been a pleasure to work with, but I would recommend doing something like a course before starting a big project with it. We had to do a lot of trial and error before we started utilizing everything to the max.
