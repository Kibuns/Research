## What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?
According to the Interaction Design Foundation agile development is
> an iterative software-development methodology which teams use in projects. Self-organized, cross-functional teams frequently analyze circumstances and user needs to adapt projects. Scrum teams constantly improve quality in sprints with short-term deliverables. They show Agile development in action.

According to the Agile Alliance agile development is 
> an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it.

The Agile Manifesto is a document that sets out the key values and principles behind the Agile philosophy
and serves to help development teams work more efficiently and sustainably.
In the Agile manifesto, there are 4 key values. These are:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile also has 12 base principles which are the following(according to the Agile Alliance):
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


## Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
There is no general consensus on which methods are the most popular, but by comparing multiple sources it seems that the following 3 are always near the top:
1. Scrum
2. KanBan
3. Extreme Programming

## Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book? 

## Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum?
