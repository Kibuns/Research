# Agile Research

## What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?
According to the Interaction Design Foundation agile development is
> an iterative software-development methodology which teams use in projects. Self-organized, cross-functional teams frequently analyze circumstances and user needs to adapt projects. Scrum teams constantly improve quality in sprints with short-term deliverables. They show Agile development in action.

According to the Agile Alliance agile development is 
> an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it.

The Agile Manifesto is a document that sets out the key values and principles behind the Agile philosophy
and serves to help development teams work more efficiently and sustainably.
In the Agile manifesto, there are 4 key values. These are:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

Agile also has 12 base principles which are the following(according to the Agile Alliance):
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


## Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
There is no general consensus on which methods are the most popular, but by comparing multiple sources it seems that the following 3 are always near the top:
1. Scrum

One of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development methodology, which is depicted by various cycles of development. Similar to Kanban, Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called ‘sprints’. The development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, thereby managing only one sprint at a time.

2. KanBan

The word Kanban is of Japanese origin and its meaning is linked to a time concept, “just-in-time”. In practice, the Kanban method exists in a board or table (Kanban board), divided into columns, that shows every flow of the software production. As the development evolves, the information contained in the table changes, and when a new task comes into play, a new “card” is created.
The Kanban method requires communication and transparency so that the members of a team can know exactly at what stage the development is and can see the status of the project at any time. [source](https://www.xpand-it.com/blog/top-5-agile-methodologies/)

3. Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and feedback. It focuses on constant development and customer satisfaction. Similar to scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a team to create a productive and highly efficient environment.

## Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book? 
Scrum is a framework that focusses on teamwork. It got it's name from rugby, because in this sport, teamwork is also very important. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experience (training), look at succes to see what went well, and look at failure to see what can be improved, just like a rugby team. To allow for this reflection, scrum teams are encouraged to develop iteratively. Planning, sprints, standups, and retrospectives to have a continuous overview of the project, and be able to continually improve.

## Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum?
