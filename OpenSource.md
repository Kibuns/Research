# What should a novice software developer know before their first contribution to an open source project?
This research will give information to beginning software developers or engineers who are interested in making their first contribution to an open source project. 
## What is open source software?
According to [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source):
> The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

And OSS(Open Source Software) is
> software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

Some examples of popular open source projects are:
- Linux operating system
- Android by Google
- Open office
- Firefox browser
- VCL media player
- Moodle
- ClamWinantivirus
- WordPress content management system

## Why do people work on OSS?
There are multiple reasons why someone might want to work on an open source project. The most notable ones are described below

### Learning how to code
The best ways to learn how to code are to A, code something and B, see how someone else codes. You will be doing a lot of both of these when you work on OSS. All code in OSS is available to the public, so everybody can read, change and learn from eachother.

### Helping the community
When you work on OSS you are adding value to it. Which can be extremely rewarding, especially if it's software that a lot of people use or software that you use yourself.

### Building a portfolio
Your github might be the most important thing in your resume. So it can be really helpfull to work on OSS to show your motivation, skills and interests. Consistently working on OSS shows your employer that you are involved.

## What are the most important work etiquettes when working on an open-source project?

### Have a reason to be working on an OSP
Before you make a contribution, think about what you want to get out of it. It's fine to just think "I'm bored and I want to do something productive" because of the "do something productive" part. You most likely want to improve your skills, show of your skills or just help others. Definitely **don't** start working on an OSP if you just want to show of how amazing you are, troll / boss people around, or just want someone to talk to.

### Be kind
Working on an OSP requires you to communicate a lot. Be sure to be polite and avoid offensive language during these conversations. Being kind to other contributers will result in a happier an more productive atmosphere. some ways to achieve this are:
- Thanking the people who help you
- Congratulating people when appropriate
- Always respond respectfully, even if i.e. someone obviously didn't read teh documentation and you need to correct them.
- Help people in a supportive way. When you correct someone, don't say "this is wrong" or "here is the answer", say something along the lines of "this is OK, but I feel like it would be better is it was more in this way..., here are some links that could help you". 

### If there's documentation, read it.
Often, contributers on an OSP spend a lot of time documenting the project for people like you to read and get all the info you need. It would be a shame if those people or people that are familiar with the documentation constantly have to correct you on everything. Ofcourse you can ask question, but make first your answer isn't already in the documentation. Most projects have a CONTRIBUTING.md and/or a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. Here you can find all of the guidelines, be sure to read and follow these.

### Avoid duplicate issues

### Provide sufficient information when making a bug report

### Make progress, not noise
