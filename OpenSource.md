## What is open source software?
According to [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source):
> The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

And OSS(Open Source Software) is
> software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

Some examples of popular open source projects are:
- Linux operating system
- Android by Google
- Open office
- Firefox browser
- VCL media player
- Moodle
- ClamWinantivirus
- WordPress content management system

## Why do people work on OSS?
There are multiple reasons why someone might want to work on an open source project. The most notable ones are desribed below

### Learning how to code
The best ways to learn how to code are to A, code something and B, see how someone else codes. You will be doing a lot of both of these when you work on OSS. All code in OSS is available to the public, so everybody can read, change and learn from eachother.

### Helping the community
When you work on OSS you are adding value to it. Which can be extremely rewarding, especially if it's software that a lot of people use or software that you use yourself. It might even give you bragging rights by being able to say something like "I helped develop linux" or something along thosel lines. 

### Building a portfolio
Your github might be the most important thing in your resume. So it can be really helpfull to work on OSS to show your motivation, skills and interests. Consistently working on OSS shows your employer that you are involved.
