# Business Research

## What is a business process? 
A business proces is a sequence of steps that are done by a group of stakeholders to accomplish a specific goal. Every step in such process is a task that is assigned to a participant. 

## How a business proces relates to software applications? 
In a business process, the creator will have defined all the possible steps in advance. This is why business processes can be applied to software applications. People will give inputs, accept outputs and handdle exceptions. But the software will do the process itself. 

## Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform? 
The software that we are making for our group projects automates the task that a restaurant waiter normally has to do regarding taking orders. We have made a systems that allows customers to seat themselves, scan a QR code, and get a menu on their phone. From that menu they will be able to orders food and drinks. Which will be added to their bill and brought to their table by the staff without having to actually talk to anybody.

When a customer makes an order, this order will be sent to the kitchen dashboard, where a kitchen staff member will be able to see all the orders and label them as "in progress" and "done" which helps with managing all the orders. All new orders will also be automatically ordered by time, so the oldest orders are getting made first. 

## Which is the process that your software supports/automates? Can you visualize it in a diagram?
tthe process of seating people and taking their order is automated, see the diagram below:

## Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence? 
This process will mainly influence the work of the waiters. They dont have to walk around and take peoples orders anymore. They also don't have to give the guests a menu, or change all of the menu covers when there is a change in the menu. They will need to learn how to use the admin panel to make changes to the menu when needed. 

The customer doesn't have to wait for a waiter to take their order, they can order from their phone as soon as they sit down. Which makes things faster. 

The kitchen staff receive all orders on the kitchen dashboard, which has built in features (described above) that make organizing work easier for them.

## Which steps of the process does your software support/automate? Can you visualize this in a diagram?

The first step that gets automated is the guests getting the menu on their phones by scanning a QR code and being assigned to a table. This automates the old process of giving the guests the menu when they arrive, and manually changing every menu when there is something that need to be changes (for example the price of a dish). This can now be done using the admin panel. Making a change there will immediately update the menu on every guests phone or tablet.
