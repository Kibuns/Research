# Ethics

## What is ethics in software engineering?
According to [Donald Gotterbarn](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF3700/v12/undervisningsmateriale/Software%20engeneering%20ethics.pdf):
> Software engineering ethics establishes principles of conduct that members of the profession are expected to observe in the practice of software engineering.

"ethics" in this context means any deliberate action which impacts the lives and values of others, either negatively or positively.

ACM, the committee on professional ethics lists eight principles software engineers should follow, below are these principles described in a simplified way:
1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
## Why is ethics important in software engineering? 
Technology becomes a bigger part in our lives by the day. Behind this technology are often software engineers that have designed the things you see on your screen, and the way the systems that you use work. software engineering is one of the more influencing practices we have today that is shaping society. Today, the consequences of software are often ignored by their creators, who don't want to take responsibility. When that happens, platforms like Facebook or Reddit can be sources of fake news and misinformation. Or mobile games luring children to make in-app purchases on their parents' behalf. These types of practices can be prevented when software engineers learn and actually start to care about ethics and think about the consequences of their software.

## What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 
Firstly you can learn and use the eight ethical principles described above. 


## How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 

# Culture

## What is culture? 
## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
## How can cultures be clustured? 
## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 
## What is your culture? 
## How would you  act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
