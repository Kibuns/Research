# Ethics

## What is ethics in software engineering?
According to [Donald Gotterbarn](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF3700/v12/undervisningsmateriale/Software%20engeneering%20ethics.pdf):
> Software engineering ethics establishes principles of conduct that members of the profession are expected to observe in the practice of software engineering.

"ethics" in this context means any deliberate action which impacts the lives and values of others, either negatively or positively.

ACM, the committee on professional ethics lists eight principles software engineers should follow, below are these principles described in a simplified way:
1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
## Why is ethics important in software engineering? 
Technology becomes a bigger part in our lives by the day. Behind this technology are often software engineers that have designed the things you see on your screen, and the way the systems that you use work. software engineering is one of the more influencing practices we have today that is shaping society. Today, the consequences of software are often ignored by their creators, who don't want to take responsibility. When that happens, platforms like Facebook or Reddit can be sources of fake news and misinformation. Or mobile games luring children to make in-app purchases on their parents' behalf. These types of practices can be prevented when software engineers learn and actually start to care about ethics and think about the consequences of their software.

## What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 
You can learn and use the eight ethical principles described above. The reason why things often go wrong (like in the examples about facebook and mobile apps given above) is that software engineers ignore certain points of principle 1. PUBLIC. Does using childrens tendencies as a way to make money act consistently with the public interest? No. Do platforms like facebook take full responsibility for spreading fake news (principle 1.01)? No. The reason that this principle often gets overlooked is because of greed. Not monitoring fake news saves money, letting it spread also increases user engagement. Luring children to buy your in-app purchases... makes money. As a software engineer, try your best to think about what you are doing, even when you get paid to do it. Try to design without ill intent, even if it will probably make you a lot of money. 

## How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 
You communicate with them. Communication within this field is not only important to get the work done, but also to create an environment where everybody is on the same line. When someone makes a decision that you don't agree with, speak up. Especially when it's a superior. 


# Culture

## What is culture? 
Accoring to  Stephanie Pappas and Callum McKelvie
> "Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts."

The Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition goes a step further, defining culture as
> "shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs and understanding that are learned by socialization. Thus, culture can be seen as the growth of a group identity fostered by social patterns unique to the group."

> "Culture encompasses religion, food, what we wear, how we wear it, our language, marriage, music, what we believe is right or wrong, how we sit at the table, how we greet visitors, how we behave with loved ones, and a million other things,"

Cristina De Rossi, an anthropologist at Barnet and Southgate College in London, told Live Science.

## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
The aspects that you will likely come in contact with are things likes languages, religion, norms and values and social habits. 
It's important that you know what cultural awareness is. It's being aware that cultural differences and similarities exist, and not judge people based on those differences and similarities. Trying to be open minded about these things lets you observe certain cultural differences without labeling them as "right" or "wrong". Even when faced with things from other cultures that you don't understand, try to stay open minded an respectfully ask for clarification if you think that you need to. 


## How can cultures be clustured?


## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 
There can be a lot of misunderstanding when people from different cultures interact. A harmless thing in one culture might mean something offensive in another. Below are some examples from [Study Abroad](https://www.studyabroad.pk/news-event/most-common-cultural-misunderstandings-4448)

1. Hand Gestures
> It is always advised to mind your body language when in an unknown company especially if you in a foreign country. Sometimes, the hand gestures you make can have different meanings than what they had in your country.
> You must be aware of OK sign you make with your thumbs up. In Iran it is considered an insult. It’s known as a ‘bilakh’, which is a substitute to what showing middle finger means.

2. Embracing
> Embracing is one of the ways to greet in most parts of the world but not in all parts of the world. There are some countries where trying to embrace might get you embarrassed. In East Asia it’s advised to keep a respectful distance. Likewise, if you are in one of Buddhist countries, just don’t touch their head because there head is considered sacred and if someone touches it is a serious insult to them. In Qatar, men and women are forbidden to publicly embrace one another.

3. Using Words Carefully:

> Words can be sharper than a sword, they should always be used carefully even if you are in homeland. But on international level, they literally create a great of confusion and awkwardness. Sometimes, wrong pronunciation can cause misunderstanding and often one word may have different meaning in different cultures or countries. Here is an example of it that a friend shared on online portal.
 
> “While I was studying Spanish in Mexico during the early 80’s, I once made a mistake of asking a single Mexican woman if a situation had made her “embarasada”. That of course, means pregnant, rather than embarrassed which they refer to verguenza (shame). Her shock was mirrored in my very red face, but I was feeling shame for sure; I wasn’t embarasada.”

## What is your culture?
Cultural identity can be very subjective. It can be influenced by all kinds of things, it can for example be influenced by the feeling that you belong to a group of people like you. It can even be influenced by your norms and values. I personally mainly identify with the latter. I value my personal norms and values very high when thinking about my culture. These are the things that I believe in and think are right. And it that way, I think that the people who have similar norms and values are like me, which in turn makes me feel apart of a group. However, I also think keeping an open mind to others' idea's is very important. I'm guaranteed to interact with people who have vastly different opinions than me, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't respects them. That's why I always try to be open minded of other people's opinions and cultures.
My cultural identity is also influenced by my interests, the way I dress, and just the way I express myself to others.


## How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
I will try to stay open minded when I'm faced with something that I deem as "wrong", "bad" or "weird". When that happens, I could respectfully ask for clarification, or even do some research of my own. When faced with difficulties while communicating, I'll be patient with the other person and try to work it out in a professional way. I'll also listen to any complaints they may have about me, since they could also see the thing I do as "wrong, "bad" or "weird". When this happens I will try to come up with a solution that's fair for both parties.
